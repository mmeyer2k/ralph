# ralph
A semi-secure symmetric encryption library that sometimes eats crayons.

Ralph provides acceptable security in situations where size is critical.
All major security parameters are 64 bit (block, iv and checksum).
As a result, input strings under 8 bytes long result in a 24 byte binary cypher text.

```php
$encrypted = ralph()::encrypt('secret', 'password');

var_dump(base64_encode($encrypted));
#string(32) "EYa5DeoDSJiRQmeaPE42qXGPExXtXeEu"

$decrypted = ralph()::decrypt($encrypted, 'password');

var_dump($decrypted);
#string(6) "secret"
```

Ralph isn't very smart, so he registers himself the in global namespace `\Ralph`.
He also registers a global helper function `ralph()` for your convenience. 

## how it works
Encryption is achieved by XORing the message with a keystream generated by `hash_hkdf()`.
The effective maximum number of bytes that can be encrypted with this method is to `16kb`.
To prevent leakage of message size, PKCS#7 padding is applied in 64 bit "blocks".

## install
Ralph is compatible with PHP versions 7.1 to 8.1.
```bash
composer require mmeyerk/ralph main-dev
```

## specs
 - 64 bit initialization vector
 - 64 bit checksum (sha3-256)
 - 64 bit block padding (PKCS#7)
